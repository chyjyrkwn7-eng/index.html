"""Draw the Nova app icon and write it into index.html.

The icon before this was a detailed illustration - a gradient sphere with a
starburst, an orbiting moon and a small N - on a purple field, with rounded
corners baked into the image. It did not read as an iOS icon: too much detail
to survive 60pt, a colour family from nowhere in iOS, and no sense of a lit
surface. The baked corners were an outright bug, because iOS applies its own
mask on top and rounds an already-rounded image.

What replaces it follows what iOS system icons actually do:

  * FULL-BLEED SQUARE, no corner rounding and no transparency. iOS masks the
    icon itself; anything rounded here gets rounded twice.
  * One idea, readable at 60pt - the V from NOVA, nothing else.
  * The dark greys iOS uses for its own dark surfaces (systemGray5 #2C2C2E to
    systemGray6 #1C1C1E), so it sits among them rather than against them.
  * A lit surface, not a flat fill: a soft overhead highlight, a hairline of
    light along the top edge, a shadow under the glyph and a specular pass
    along its upper edges. Subtle - at icon size this reads as depth, and
    anything stronger reads as a sticker.

The V keeps Nova's own gradient (#FFD37A gold to #C23B7A magenta, the same
three stops as the wordmark and the hero sphere), because it is the one thing
that makes the icon Nova's rather than any dark app's.

    python3 tools/gen-app-icon.py                  # write into index.html
    python3 tools/gen-app-icon.py --variant white  # see --variant --help

Writes all three places the icon lives - the apple-touch-icon link, the
<link rel="icon"> favicon, and the icons inside the base64 manifest - because
they must never drift apart, and they did: an earlier pass updated two of the
three and left every browser tab showing the old artwork. The manifest is
decoded, edited as JSON and re-encoded, never hand-patched.
